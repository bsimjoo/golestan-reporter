## What is golestan?
Golestan is a legacy system! most of Iranian universities use this system for news and storing students information.

## what does golestan reporter do?
Golestan Reporter is useful for Iranian students. This app uses an internal database to send the latest news uploaded to Golestan via email.

## Why we store students other information?
My idea is to use a single database for all of my future projects for university students.
